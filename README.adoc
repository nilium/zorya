Zorya
=====
:author: Noel Cower


Zorya is an experimental reimplementation of the
https://github.com/nilium/rusalka-vm[Rusalka virtual machine] in Go. It is
intended for learning purposes and not much else.

This will likely only implement a subset of Rusalka and refrain from using
specially-typed value objects as is available in C++ unless I can find a way to
make those make sense in the context of Go.
